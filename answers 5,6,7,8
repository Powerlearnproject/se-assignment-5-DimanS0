VS Code Power Tools: Terminal, Files, Settings, Debugging, and Git
Integrated Terminal:

Opening: Access the integrated terminal in two ways:

Menu: Go to Terminal > New Terminal (or View > Terminal).
Shortcut: Press Ctrl + \ (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + \ (macOS).
Advantages:

Convenience: Seamless switching between code and terminal without leaving VS Code.
Integration: Built-in features like working directory linked to the active file and error detection within the terminal output.
Customization: You can change the terminal theme, font size, and shell settings to match your preferences.
File and Folder Management:

Creating:
Right-click in the Explorer sidebar (View > Appearance > Show Side Bar) and select "New File" or "New Folder".
Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "New File" or "New Folder".
Opening:
Double-click on a file or folder in the Explorer sidebar.
Use the "Go to File" functionality (Ctrl+G) and type the file path or name.
Navigation:
Use the Explorer sidebar to browse your project structure.
Navigate between open files using the tabs at the top of the editor area or keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl + Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Tab (macOS).
Use the "Go to Definition" feature (F12) to jump to the definition of a symbol within your code.
Settings and Preferences:

Finding Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS).
Customizing:
Theme: Search for "Theme" and select your preferred theme (e.g., Dark+ or One Dark Pro).
Font Size: Search for "Font Size" and adjust it to your liking.
Keybindings: Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts" and modify keybindings for specific actions (advanced users).
Debugging:

1. Set Up:

Install the appropriate language extension for debugging support (e.g., "C/C++").
Create a "launch.json" file in your project's .vscode folder to configure debugging settings specific to your program. Refer to VS Code documentation or extension documentation for configuration details.
2. Start Debugging:

Set breakpoints in your code by clicking next to line numbers.
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Start Debugging".
Select the appropriate debugging configuration for your program.
VS Code will pause execution at your breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code line by line, and identify errors.
Debugging Features:

Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific points in your code.
Step Commands: Step through your code line by line or by function calls.
Variable Inspection: Examine the values of variables during execution.
Call Stack: View the history of function calls to understand code flow.
Console: Interact with your program by printing messages or reading input during debugging.
Using Source Control with Git:

Integration: VS Code has built-in Git support. No additional installation is necessary.
Initializing: Open the integrated terminal and run git init in your project directory to create a Git repository.
Commits: Stage changes with the Source Control view (Source Control tab) and commit them with a descriptive message using the commit message box.
Pushing: Push your commits to a remote repository like GitHub. Use commands like git remote add origin <remote_url> and git push -u origin main (replace with your specific remote URL and branch name).
